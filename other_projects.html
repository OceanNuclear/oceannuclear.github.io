									<h2 id="MCNP">MCNP</h2>
									<p>Monte Carlo N-Particle transport modelling</p>
								</header>
								<p><a href="https://mcnp.lanl.gov/">MCNP</a> is a software used for modelling the distribution and energy deposited by neutrons, photos (gamma-rays) and electrons (beta particles) from a radioactive source onto its surroundings. It is a commonly used code in the nuclear industry. It <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/MCNP">formed an essential part of the PTNR training</a>.</p>

								As you can see, aesthetics was not a primary concern for the creators of MCNP.</p>

								<p>FORTRAN77 assignment for MSc PTNR</p>
								</header>
								<p>A calculator for the temperature profile of water passing through the reactor was made. <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/FORTRANReactorTemp/blob/master/FortranReport.pdf">An accompanying report</a> was produced along with the <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/FORTRANReactorTemp/blob/master/.pdf">code</a>, both of which can be viewed on the <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/FORTRANReactorTemp/">relevant GitHub repository</a>. The grade is noted in the <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/FORTRANReactorTemp#readme">README file</a>. </p>

									<h2 id="GULP">GULP</h2>
									<p>Computational nuclear materials modelling using GULP: General Utility Lattice Program</p>
								</header>
								<p>I have an interest in materials modelling due to my background in BSc Nuclear Science and Materials. Therefore I was delighted to try out the <a href="https://github.com/OceanNuclear/ComputationalNuclearMaterialsModelling">GULP</a> materials modelling code as part of the PTNR's optional Computational Nuclear Materials Modelling course.</p>

									<h2 id="R">R</h2>
									<p>Nuclear Lab data analysis R</p>
								</header>
								<p>In the field that I'm working in (Nuclear physics/materials), R is a language that is rarely used, and therefore I have less practice with it.</p>

									<h2 id="ML">Machine Learning</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I am proficient with training and using feedforward neural networks and other supervised and unsupervised techniques for machine learning. My MSc thesis focused on applying neural networks in fusion neutron spectra unfolding.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="post">
								<header>
									<h2 id="CPP">C++</h2>
									<p>C++ assignments</p>
								</header>
								<p>Some <a href="https://github.com/oceannuclear/c_Assignments">C++ projects</a> were completed in my first and second year of the BSc degree.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="post">
								<header>
									<h2 id="detectors"><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Radiation+Detection+and+Measurement%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470131480">Radiation detection and measurement</a></h2>
									<p>Theoretical understanding and hands-on experience</p>
								</header>
								<p>The BSc and MSc degrees gave me a lot of opportunities to learn about and use radiation detectors, including HPGe, NaI, CsI, BF<sub>3</sub>, <sup>3</sup>He, coincidence timing detector, etc., in the nuclear laboratory as well as the class. The auxiliary electronics were also taught in detail. Therefore I am reasonably familiar with their operations.</p>

									<h2 id="numerical">Computational mathematical skills</h2>
									<p>Mathematical skills leveraging the computational power of a modern processor</p>
								</header>
								<blockquote>Power is nothing without control</blockquote>
								<p>As stated in my <a href="index.html#main">about me</a>  page, I am a strong advocate for thinking before doing, rather than blindly throwing computational power at a problem to solve it by brute force.<br />
								This is what the tricks inside the book <a href="http://www.numerical.recipes/">numerical recipes</a> are helpful for. These tricks include better ways of performing integration, differentiation, and solving ODE's.<br />
								Another important skill that I think is beneficial for all scientists is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers">automatic differentiation</a>.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section class="post">
								<header>
									<h2 id="other_maths">Other mathematical areas of interests</h2>
									<p>Inverse problems, iterative algorithms, optimization problems, matrix differentiation, Lagrangian multipliers, uncertainty propagation</p>
								</header>
								<p>These are some areas which I can confidently say that I have some knowledge about due to my work in the neutron spectrum unfolding PhD, and are therefore confident at applying these skills onto physics problems.
								However, I am always looking to expand on this list, and I am by no means restricted to these topics only. <br />
								<br />
								Graph theory, chaos theory, and control theory are also areas which I find either both useful and beautifully awe-striking, but I can't say that I have a firm grasp on all of them yet.

								<p>Send me your obscure mathematical or physical problem, and let's see if I can solve it.<br />
								Effectively I'm working as a freelance consultant, where some would charge <a href='https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/physics'> over $100/hr.</a><br />
								But if you manage to describe the problem succtinctly and pique my interest, I shall do it for free.

							<p>Or, if you're just a friend passing by my website, it would be nice to see your message too :)</p>
