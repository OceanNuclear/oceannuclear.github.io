1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. Regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.

    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
