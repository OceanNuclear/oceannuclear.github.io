Before end of thesis:
[]Edit chapter 1 - 3
[]Line 70-71 of 1-*tex
[]Plot Grid
[]Plot L-curve
[]Plot PurelyIterativeDescent
[]What if I just cut away everything with >2 sigmas and see what's left

[]Optimize the decision tree by using absolute positions
    - E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\AlgorithmCategorizationFlowChartReshaped.tex
    - reference: E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\ContextDiagramFlat.tex
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
Later (maybe June):
[]Try Motion.ai
[]Check if I could've benefitted from a less efficient communication network (mentor-mentee)
