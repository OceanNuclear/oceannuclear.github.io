1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.
Wednesday:
[]Listen to fusion materials

[]Answer Mitja
    - Overeaf
Sunday:
[]Edit chapter 1 - 3
[]Draft emails to Alison asking if I need can write \gamma-ray everywhere
    - gamma-ray spectrum or gamma-spectrum? Should I write γ or gamma?
    - gamma-ray spectrum acquisition, gamma-spectrum acquisition, or gamma-acquisition? Should I write γ or gamma?
    - [gamma-ray detector] or gamma-detector
    - gamma-ray line, gamma line or gamma-line? (referring specifically to a single entry on the decay data file recording one gamma line's energy and intensity) Should I write γ or gamma?
    - like https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat3/decaysearchdirect.jsp?nuc=60Co&unc=NDS#:~:text=6.3E%2D5%207-,1173.228,-3%C2%A0
    []These things: Do I write γ or gamma?
    - gamma-ray count(s)
    - gamma-ray detection system
    - gamma-ray detector(s)
    - ... with no observable gamma-ray emission.
    - ... the range of detectible gamma-ray energies that may be logged on the ADC.
    - gamma-ray spectroscopy
    - ... discarding any non-gamma-ray related decay information ...
Monday checklist:

Before end of thesis:
[]Line 70-71 of 1-*tex
[]Plot Grid
[]Plot L-curve
[]Plot PurelyIterativeDescent
[]What if I just cut away everything with >2 sigmas and see what's left
[]Notations and glossary: write script to convert back to .md so to allow live editing.
[]Optimize the decision tree by using absolute positions
    - E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\AlgorithmCategorizationFlowChartReshaped.tex
    - reference: E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\ContextDiagramFlat.tex
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
[]Check if I could've benefitted from a less efficient communication network (mentor-mentee)
