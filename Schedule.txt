1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
Saturday:
[]UMG unfolding (40 mins)
    []It's all in /home/ocean/Others/unfoldinggroup/unfolding/unfoldingsuite/UMG3.3_source
[]Find scale factor for each foil! (1.3 hours)
[]Investigate possible self-shielding (40 mins)
    []Look into sigma_df matrix (20 mins)
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not as simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
