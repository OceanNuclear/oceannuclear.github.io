1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.

[]Should choose 17-Er-ignoringoldirradiation! Because that's the .activity file present
    - /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/ExperimentalVerification/results/17_ER_bgsubtracted.activity
    - /home/ocean/Self/FoilSelector/NewChipIR/PostHocShorter
[]Try to rename everything used in the PostHocShorter/ (except final_name) to be '02-Cu-contact' etc.
    - /home/ocean/Self/FoilSelector/NewChipIR/PostHocShorter
    - .selected_foils.json
    - irradiation_schedule.txt
    - step6 -> response_matrix.csv
    - step2 -> .atomic_composition.json (just fix the .json manually, don't go through step2.)
    []things to INCLUDE:

[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not as simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
