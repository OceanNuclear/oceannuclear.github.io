1. Serialize to the correct level. 2. Constraint deadline, maximize quality, rather than vice versa.
3. Use checklist of what materials and info needs to be at hand for each task. 4. Break day in four.
Sunday:
[]Send email about Thresholding
    - either 48 or 64
[]New thresholding strategy
    []1.Inspect each spectrum, and find their background
        []Write backgroud files to a BG/ directory next to new_data
    []2. Acceptance threshold = Significance threshold extrapolated from Poisson distribution of BG
    []3. All lines > acceptance threshold = included
    []4. Nuclides with no lines = excluded from library
[]Tell Kristen to email HR
[]Incrementally delete nuclides in NLB
    - /media/ocean/OS/GENIE2K/CAMFILES/actifoils/8* and 9*
[]Appropriate python script plot_activity.py below to extract .RPT files' activities only.
    []Choose the .RPTs with most variety of nuclide identified using this script.

[]Make fortnightly report
    []/media/ocean/OS/GENIE2K/REPFILES/plot_activity.py
    []/home/ocean/Documents/PhD/ExperimentalVerification/data/experiment*/data-quality-control
PhD:
[]Check Genie's manual for all four stages of the analysis methods that I used (2 hours)
    - /media/ocean/OS/GENIE2K/pdfs/docs/Genie 2000 Customization Tools Manual.pdf 279-, 304, 321, 330, 339, 348, ?352 +4
[]Overlay APPROXIMATE expected spectrum with real spec
    []Widen to FWHM
    []Plot against real spectrum
    []including the uncertainty calculation part
Daily task:
[]One of the following learning things:
    []MOOC (Coursera/ edX/ Academic Earth)
    []SeptembRSE /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/Seminars_conferences/SeptembeRSE/sessions.ods
    []http://software-training.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/software-best-practices/#32 (1 hour)
    []Social media & Sci+Math tab
        []Netflix Vox series
    []Clean e-mailboxes
Later:
[]Link to the accountability.html page by adding a link on the top of every page (10 mins)
    []Add button to poke/remind myself (or tell me that I'm doing well?) (50 mins)
        - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit
        []Implement a send-email form as well
        []Check other website's send-email form and buttons
        []Test button + email form
    []Consider changing them to days of the week?
[]All of the rest of the unfinished ideas in
    - /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/unfinished-work.txt
[]Make they played us for absolute fools meme for climbing?
[]Straighten up sublime package management
[]Sort the rest of the SeptemRSE lectures into calendar
