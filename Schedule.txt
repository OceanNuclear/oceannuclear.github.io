1. Serialize to the correct level. 2. Constraint deadline, maximize quality, rather than vice versa.
3. Use checklist of what materials and info needs to be at hand for each task. 4. Break day in four.
Tuesday:
[]Google forms (15 mins)
5pm
[]edit together fispact video (3 hours)
    []Record video (10 mins)
        []Prep (30 mins)
    []Narration (10 mins)
[]Make ggbins that fit the existing gamma spectrum (10 mins)
    []Check the ggbins format (5 mins)
    []Make python script in ~/Doc*/PhD/Exp*/analysis/*.py (10 mins)
[]/home/ocean/Documents/PhD/ExperimentalVerification/results (10 mins)
    - sample files are in /home/ocean/Self/FoilSelector/ChipIR/fispact_simulation
    - executable is in /home/ocean/Documents/FISPACT-II-3-20/fispact/exec/Ubuntu-14.04-X86/gfortran/fispact (already saved in fispact)
    - tutorial and docs are in /home/ocean/Others/FISPACT-II-3-20/TutorialTest/workshops/2019_manchester/exercises/doc
    - Saved to /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/ExperimentalVerification/fispact/*/*/
    []Configure the UNCERTAINTY and GRAPH keywords correctly (25 mins)
    []Use foilselector/simulation/*.py to translate existing schedules into fispact schedules (25 mins)
    []Compare the ATOMS SPECTRUM or STEP keywords (10 mins)
    []Run the a priori once (1 hour)
        []Create FISPACT .o for the a priori and check the PATHWAY (1 hour)
        []highlight and discount nuclides that are consumed in large fraction by burn up (1 hour)
        []Save the PATHWAY's list of number of decays (1 hour)
[]Shape of gamma spec overlay fispact vs real (10 mins)
    []Convolve -> widen to FWHM (0.75 hours)
    []Plot against real spectrum (2 hours)
[]Choose group structure:
    []Convince myself that equal-lethargy is the most doable option
        []See how far does the 709 or 110? native group structures deviate from this

Daily task:
[]One of the following learning things:
    []MOOC (Coursera/ edX/ Academic Earth)
    []SeptembRSE /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/Seminars_conferences/SeptembeRSE/sessions.ods

Later:
[]All of the rest of the unfinished ideas in
    - /home/ocean/Documents/PhD/unfinished-work.txt
[]Make they played us for absolute fools meme for climbing?
[]Straighten up sublime package management
[]Sort the rest of the SeptemRSE lectures into calendar
