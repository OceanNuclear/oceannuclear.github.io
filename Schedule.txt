1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.
Thursday morning:
[]Plot the context diagram/factor relationship map (Tikz) (1.5 hours)
    - try with [tikz]{standalone}
[]Translate 4-FoilSelector.tex to 4.Foil Selector.md (1 hour)
[]Plot Grid
[]Plot L-curve
[]Plot PurelyIterativeDescent
[]Plan around the AMAXED abstract submission for SOFE
    []Send off emails for supervision team
        []Give them a week to read, set up meeting for next week?
        []Talk about irradiation end graphics too - I want permission to use it.
[]Reword the title
Friday:
[]Call XC again, cause they're a fucking piece of shit that doesn't let me fill out my bank details for no fucking reason (03447 369 123)
[]Gym
Saturday:

[]Reply to Robin's email about PhD funding
Before end of thesis:
[]Notations and glossary: write script to convert back to .md so to allow live editing.
[]What if I just cut away everything with >2 sigmas and see what's left
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not 
    simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?

Daily task: One novel thing per day:
[]Exercise/hobby: Skatehouse, Fellrunning, Broadfield park, Hangar, Foundry Climbing, Cross Fit Kelham, Cyr wheel
