1. Serialize to the correct level. 2. Constraint deadline, maximize quality, rather than vice versa.
3. Use checklist of what materials and info needs to be at hand for each task. 4. Break day in four.

[]/home/ocean/Self/FoilSelector/NewChipIR/709_short/Populations/limit_lst.py
    []/media/ocean/OS/Genie/Genie/analysis/Populations/max_sum/lst_to_ahk.py with a new lst_file_list and rel_save_path
[]Using a quick-to-fail mindset, try all 8 binary combinations of N,M,L=
    []77,unlimited,1024 (most likely to work)
    []84,unlimited,900 (try to push the limit on N)
    []84,unlimited,1024 (improve performance)
    []small-number,54,900 (disprove the existence of an upper limit on M as 54)
    []small-number,77,900 (push the upper limit on M to equal to upper limit on N)
    []small-number,84,900 (push the upper limit on M to equal to upper limit on N)
    - N= max num lines
    - M= tot. num nuc
    - L= tot. num lines
[]Check if I can get rid of the "V M S" section
[]Account for Kc and Kw?
