1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.
Thursday:
[]Make PIL re-draw on desktop background everytime (steal from existing code) (15 mins)
    []Testing (30 mins)
[]Minor problem in Scheduler.py, need to align with behaviour of logtask.py?
    []incomplete task with complete parent task needs to be overriden as completed?
    - nah

[]Buy train ticket
[]Visa application
[]A demo of unidirectional irradiation and ambient irradiation made in Google Slides or PPT (15 mins)

[]Schedule weekend: Sunday climb stuff
[]Schedule weekend; Saturday night stay
[]Reply to Tim's email

[]Plot Grid
[]Plot L-curve
[]Plot PurelyIterativeDescent
Friday:
[]Plan around the AMAXED abstract submission for SOFE
[]What is this interesting thing about benchmark
    \cite{Benchmarking1, oster1977review}
    - apparently they exist (but went nowhere, probably because this cannot generalize to underdetermined/ can't find a good spectrum that covers all cases/ can't think of an a priori)
[]Draw mindmap of required sections in Chapter 3
Monday:
[]Worry about sending Abstract
[]Floral language guessing game(20 mins)
[]Reply to Robin's email about PhD funding
Before end of thesis:
[]What if I just cut away everything with >2 sigmas and see what's left
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not 
    simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?

Daily task: One novel thing per day:
[]Exercise/hobby: Skatehouse, Fellrunning, Broadfield park, Hangar, Foundry Climbing, Cross Fit Kelham, Cyr wheel
[]One of the following learning things:
