1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.

    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not as 
    simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
