1. Break tasks down to <30 minutes chunks. 2. Break day in four, separated by life-admin tasks.
3. Self-declare subtle incapacitation of executive funtion (task initiation function) early -> break.
4. regulate stimulus level by playing lectures in the background.
Monday:

[]RUN. A. WHOLE. FOIL SELECTION PROCESS.
[]Clean floor
[]Buy train ticket to Birmingham! for Monday
[]Gym

[]Wash bag
[]Thesis progress:
    - Formulation and assumptions
        1. eq:ProductionRateSummationEquation
        2. eq:LinearizedSummation
        3. conversion into R
            3.1 Using Bateman equation
            3.2 Bateman convolved
            3.3 Bateman convolved and then integrated.
            3.4 diagram
            3.5 diagram
        4. - Assumption of linearity
            4.1 No significant downscattering
            4.2 no depeltion
            4.3 self-shielding
                4.3.1 get thickness limit equation
                4.3.2 show UniOmnidirectional graph
        5. Radioisotope retention assumption
        6. \textit{A priori} accuracy assumption
    - Constraints inputted by the user 
    - Parameters further fixed by the user
    
[]Plot Grid
[]Plot L-curve
[]Plot PurelyIterativeDescent
[]Plan around the AMAXED abstract submission for SOFE
    []Send off emails for supervision team
        []Give them a week to read, set up meeting for next week?
        []Talk about irradiation end graphics too - I want permission to use it.

Tuesday:
[]Call XC again, cause they're a fucking piece of shit that doesn't let me fill out my bank details for no fucking reason (03447 369 123)
Before end of thesis:
[]What if I just cut away everything with >2 sigmas and see what's left
[]Notations and glossary: write script to convert back to .md so to allow live editing.
[]Optimize the decision tree by using absolute positions
    - E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\AlgorithmCategorizationFlowChartReshaped.tex
    - reference: E:\Self\Thesis\latexExp\ContextDiagramFlat.tex
[]Optimization:
    []New metrics!
        - response matrix that causes the largest covariance minimization?
        - area under cdf(# of sv> threshold vs increasing threshold)?
    []write comb-sum function that takes in a user-define function rather than using "sum" by default
    []Curvature is not simple as "curvature per bin"! It should be curvature per eV, or PUL?
[]Check if I could've benefitted from a less efficient communication network (mentor-mentee)
