        <p>It's easy to get lazy when no one is looking. This is the idea behind the very webpage that you're looking at.</p>
        <p>I have set up my computer to automatically track the number of lines that I knock off my to-do list.</p>
        <p>You can "poke" me to remind me to stay alert and motivated when you see that I'm not being as productive as I can be.</p>
        <!-- <p>Press "Send Poke" below to send me a(n anonymous) reminder message to keep my productivity up!</p> -->
